Reproducibility report

File path: worked fine

Output: the output was dispayed perfectly!

One small thing: I had to change a line of code because of a small syntax error

df = df.dropna(subset=["Year", "Renew_share"])
df = df[df["Year"] >= 2000]

The project was very clear and easy to navigate. I enjoyed the structure, organization and clarity. 

Suggestions:
First of all, I think this project is already well-polished and excllently done. But for the sake of giving at least something that could make it even better,
I think it would be nice to add what kind of output/type of graph we should get and a brief explanation in the text format in the readme.md file. This way the collaborator will be able to
know what to expect without running the file. (i think that if we were in the work environment, this would be really helpful). 

But otherwise, your project is great.
